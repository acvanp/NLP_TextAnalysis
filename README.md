# NLP_TextAnalysis
This repo demos my basic NLP skills for mult-label / multi-class text classification using the Kaggle cases (Natural Disaster Tweets, and Toxic Comments). 

- For the Natural Disaster tweets case, I demonstrate the use of two approaches:
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - LSTM and CNN neural network classifiers
- For the Toxic Comments case, I demonstrate the use of:
  - SVM
  - Fine tuning BERT (base uncased)
